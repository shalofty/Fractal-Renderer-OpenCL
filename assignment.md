## Instructions

Create an OpenCL program that utilizes much of the lessons you have learned so far about OpenCL. It is up to the student to determine what the application does, but it should show a significant understanding of OpenCL, though it doesn't have to be extremely complex.

The more of the lessons from this section of the course included in your submission the better, so including buffers and sub-buffers, vectors, etc. will improve your grade.

There should be included in the submission, one or more scripts for building and running the application. If the application and scripts allow for command line arguments to configure how the application is run, then a higher grade can be achieved.

Beyond just the code and proof of its execution, create a one-page write-up (font 12 or 14, double spaced, etc. and it can be a little shorter or longer) to discuss what your goals were and any challenges and triumphs that you had.

For your assignment submission, you will need to include either:

- **A link to the commit/branch for your assignment submission** (preferred method), including all code and artifacts, or
- **The zipped up code** for the assignment and images/video/links that show your code completing all of the parts of the rubric that it is designed to complete in what is submitted for this assignment.
